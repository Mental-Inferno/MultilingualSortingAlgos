# A quick lesson on how the algorithms work

## MergeSort

- MergeSort is recursive, meaning it calls itself
- It is a divide-and-conquer algorithm
- It is a very efficient algorithm for large data sets

#### Big O Analysis
- Merge Sort does log n merge steps as each merge step doubles the list size
- It does n work for each merge step as it looks at every item
- It runs in **O(n logn)**
